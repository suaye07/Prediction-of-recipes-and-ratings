## Framing the Problem 

***Data Cleaning***

To create the model, I first prepared the data by cleaning it according to the requirements. I reused the dataset that was already cleaned in a previous project 3. Before starting to build the model, let's take a look at how the data table appears in its original form. This will give us an idea of what the data looks like before we begin working on the model.

|  0 |    483827 |      306785 | 2008-07-15 | Being a  huge fan of America's Test Kitchen  I just had  to try this and I am  sure glad I did. It is really good. Sweet  corn is  just  coming in season here  and I have  chives in my herb garden so I had all the  best ingredients. I did  use a Jalapeno from the  garden instead of the  habanero. I  just made this and I plan to have it with some chicken. I'll  bet you could use some nice peaches to change it up a bit.

DH loved them , I found them a bit two sweet for me but a nice change to serve strawberries.  very easy recipe, but I think 8 ounces of strawvberries is not enough, if I make them again I will double the strawberries and use about half of the cool whip. (I use light cool whip.)

***Problem Identification***
The prediction problem at hand involves determining the rating of a restaurant's overall recipe. This is a classification problem, specifically binary classification. The response variable, or the variable being predicted, is whether the restaurant's overall recipe has received reviews with a mean rating above 4 stars. This variable was chosen as it provides a clear threshold to differentiate between positive and negative evaluations.

To evaluate the model, the chosen metric is accuracy. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances, which is suitable for assessing the performance of a binary classification model. By focusing on accuracy, we can gauge the overall effectiveness of the model in correctly predicting whether a restaurant's recipe is above 4 stars or not.

While other suitable metrics such as the F1-score could be considered, accuracy was preferred in this case due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation. Given that the objective is to determine if the overall recipe meets a certain threshold, accuracy provides a straightforward measure of the model's success in achieving this goal.


## Baseline Model 

#### Accuracy: 0.8613529805760214

The model used in this project is a Random Forest Classifier, which is a machine learning algorithm capable of performing classification tasks. The model aims to predict the binary rating of a restaurant's overall recipe, whether it is above 4 stars or not.
The features included in the model are 'n_steps' and 'minutes', representing quantitative variables related to the recipe. These features are used to train the model and make predictions.
To handle the quantitative features, a preprocessing step is performed using the StandardScaler. This scaler standardizes the features by subtracting the mean and scaling to unit variance, ensuring that the variables are on a similar scale and preventing any bias in the model.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.
The preprocessor is applied to the training data using the ColumnTransformer, which specifies that the 'numeric' transformer (StandardScaler) should be applied to the 'n_steps' and 'minutes' columns.
The model is then built using a pipeline that combines the preprocessor and the Random Forest Classifier. The pipeline ensures that the preprocessing steps are applied consistently to the training and testing data.
Once the model is trained, predictions are made on the testing data using the predict function. The accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing the predicted ratings (y_pred) with the actual ratings (y_test) using the accuracy_score function.
The accuracy of the model is reported to be approximately 86.14%. This means that the model correctly classified 86.14% of the instances in the testing data.
Accuracy is a commonly used metric to evaluate classification models as it provides a straightforward measure of overall correctness. In this case, the accuracy score indicates how well the model performed in predicting whether a restaurant's overall recipe received a rating above 4 stars or not.
A higher accuracy score suggests that the model is effective in making accurate predictions. However, it is important to consider other factors specific to the problem at hand, such as the consequences of false positives or false negatives, the distribution of the classes, and any class imbalance.
While accuracy is a valuable metric, it may not be the sole determinant of the model's "goodness" in every scenario. Additional evaluation and analysis, considering domain knowledge and specific requirements, are necessary to determine the model's suitability and effectiveness in addressing the problem.

## Fairness Analysis 

Before performing the analysis, I will clean and explore the dataset. This step involves preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the variables involved. I will ensure the data is in a suitable format for further analysis.

***Data Cleaning***

First I perform data cleaning and merging of two datasets, 'raw_interactions' and 'raw_recipes', to create a combined dataset named 'combined'. In the first step, the code merges the two datasets based on the common 'recipe_id' column, removing the duplicate 'id' column in the process. Next, the code handles data quality issues by converting the 'rating' column values to NaN (missing values) if they are equal to "0". This is done using a lambda function applied to the 'rating' column. After the data cleaning, the code proceeds to merge the 'combined' dataset with the 'average_rating_per_recipe' dataset. This step adds the average rating information for each recipe based on the 'recipe_id' column.
Finally, unnecessary columns are dropped, and the 'rating_y' column is renamed to 'mean_rating' to improve clarity. The resulting dataset, named 'merged_data', is now ready for further analysis and exploration of the relationship between recipe attributes and average ratings.
Overall, this data cleaning process ensures data integrity, handles missing values, and combines relevant information from multiple datasets, setting the foundation for accurate and comprehensive analysis.
From this cleaned data, I perform the below analysis to explore relationships, patterns, and characteristics of the dataset, providing a comprehensive understanding of the data and facilitating further insights and decision-making.

***Univariate Analysis***

This analysis performs a univariate analysis on the 'rating' column. It calculates the average rating per recipe based on the number of ingredients and creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of these average ratings. This analysis allows you to understand the relationship between the number of ingredients and the average rating of recipes. The resulting histogram provides insights into the distribution of average ratings.

|   n_ingredients |   rating |
|----------------:|---------:|
|               1 |  4.30208 |
|               2 |  4.32877 |
|               3 |  4.44194 |
|               4 |  4.43527 |
|               5 |  4.39844 |

This second analysis a univariate analysis on the 'rating' column. It calculates the count of recipes for each rating and creates a pie chart to visualize the distribution of these counts. This analysis allows you to understand the distribution of recipe counts across different ratings. The resulting pie chart provides a visual representation of this distribution.

|   rating |   recipe_count |
|---------:|---------------:|
|        0 |          15035 |
|        1 |           2870 |
|        2 |           2368 |
|        3 |           7172 |
|        4 |          37307 |

Correlation coefficient between Cooking Time and Average Rating: -0.00399
A negative correlation coefficient shows an inverse relationship between the two variables being analyzed. In this analysis between cooking time and average rating of recipes, a negative correlation coefficient suggests that as the cooking time increases, the average rating tends to decrease, and vice versa. However, it's -0.00399 which indicates the very less impact between this two cooking time and rating correlation interact.

<iframe src="assets/Bivariate_Analysis_2.html" width=600 height=400 frameBorder=0></iframe>
Correlation coefficient between Cooking Time and Steps to make: 0.01169
This also indicates a very weak positive correlation. Overall, the analysis suggests a negligible relationship between cooking time and the number of steps to make in the dataset.


<iframe src="assets/Bivariate_Analysis_3.html" width=800 height=500 frameBorder=0></iframe>
This analysis is to identify the top-rated recipes with a rating of 5, cooking time less than 20 minutes, and submitted after January 1, 2018. It then creates a horizontal bar plot to compare the cooking time and number of steps for these recipes.
The purpose of this analysis is to identify highly rated recipes that require a short cooking time. By focusing on recipes with a rating of 5 and a cooking time less than 20 minutes, you can find quick and well-received recipes. Additionally, by considering recipes submitted after January 1, 2018, you narrow down the analysis to more recent recipes.
The resulting bar plot allows for a visual comparison of the cooking time and number of steps for each recipe. This helps identify recipes that achieve a high rating with minimal cooking time and a simple preparation process.
Overall, this analysis aims to provide insights into top-rated, quick-to-make recipes, helping users find appealing options that require minimal time and effort in the kitchen.

This agregates take the mean of the rating for each items and assign to the minutes that take each item to make and list it in an assencding order. The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into the relationship between cooking time and the average rating of recipes. By grouping the data by recipe name and calculating the average cooking time and mean rating, you can examine how these variables vary across different recipes. The pivot table provides a concise summary of the aggregate statistics, allowing for easy comparison and identification of recipes with shorter or longer cooking times and their corresponding average ratings.

| cooking_time_category   |   mean_rating |
|:------------------------|--------------:|
| 0-30                    |       4.44887 |
| 30-60                   |       4.36716 |
| 60-90                   |       4.31028 |
| 90+                     |       4.22396 |

This another analysis put the category into the minutes it takes to make the food and calculate the mean of the rating for each category. The purpose of this analysis is to examine the relationship between cooking time and average rating, grouped into different time categories. By categorizing the recipes based on cooking time intervals (0-30 minutes, 30-60 minutes, 60-90 minutes, and 90+ minutes), you can explore whether there are any patterns or trends in the average ratings across these categories.

Overall, this analysis helps understand if there is any correlation between cooking time and the average rating of recipes, enabling you to identify potential trends or preferences among users based on different cooking time categories.

## Baseline Model 

In this phase, I will assess the missingness in the dataset, specifically focusing on the variables related to cooking time and average rating. I will investigate if there are any patterns or correlations between missing values and other variables. Various techniques such as visualization and statistical tests will be utilized to evaluate the missingness.


***NMAR Analysis***

I believe minutes column, the cooking time in minutes might likely be fall into NMAR category. It is possible that recipes with longer cooking times might have a higher chance of missing ratings or reviews. For example, users may be less inclined to review or rate recipes that require a longer time investment.
To determine if the missingness in the "mean_rating" column is NMAR, additional data such as user demographics, recipe complexity, or user engagement metrics could be useful. These variables might help explain the missingness pattern and shed light on whether it is related to the missing ratings themselves or to other unobserved factors.
It is important to conduct further analysis and investigate the relationship between the missingness and potential explanatory variables to determine if the missingness in the "mean_rating" column is truly NMAR or if it can be explained by other factors, making it MAR (Missing at Random) or MCAR (Missing Completely at Random).

***Missingness Dependency***


<iframe src="assets/Assessment_of_Missingness.html" width=600 height=400 frameBorder=0></iframe>
p-value: 0.07

The purpose of this analysis is to explore whether the missingness of the 'description' column is related to the values in the 'n_steps' column. By examining the distribution of missing and non-missing values in the 'description' column for different groups of 'n_steps', we can assess if there is a systematic relationship between these variables. A permutation test is performed by randomly shuffling the 'n_steps' variable and computing the total variation distance (TVD) between the shuffled and original distributions. This process is repeated multiple times to create a null distribution of TVD values. The observed TVD from the original data is compared to the null distribution to compute a p-value, indicating the likelihood of observing such or more extreme TVD values under the null hypothesis of no association.

Analysis: Since p-value of 0.07, it means that there is a 7% chance of observing the observed total variation distance (TVD) or a more extreme TVD under the null hypothesis of no association between the 'n_steps' variable and the missingness of the 'description' column. This suggests that there is not strong enough evidence to conclude a significant association between the 'n_steps' variable and the missingness of the 'description' column. However, it is worth noting that the interpretation of p-values can also depend on the specific context and the desired level of significance for the analysis.

## Hypothesis Testing

To address my analysis question, "What is the relationship between the cooking time and average rating of recipes?", I will perform hypothesis testing. I will formulate appropriate null and alternative hypotheses and conduct statistical tests to determine if there is a significant relationship between cooking time and average rating. The results of the hypothesis testing will provide evidence for or against the existence of a relationship between these variables.

Null Hypothesis:The relationship between the cooking time and average rating of recipes is the greater the rating is the less cooking prep time to fullfill customer satisfaction.
Alternative Hypothesis: The relationship between the cooking time and average rating of recipes is the greater the rating is the more cooking prep time to prepare the better food.

Result: Correlation coefficient: -0.003993247071403871,
        P-value: 0.053182722882732604

Test Statistic: Mean Proportion of the cooking time and mean proportion of the rating
Siginificance level: 0.05
p-value: 0.05318
Conclusion: Since p-value is >0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

## Conclusion 

Based on the analysis and the obtained results, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis states that the greater the rating is, the less cooking prep time required to fulfill customer satisfaction. However, we did not find sufficient evidence to support this claim.

The alternative hypothesis suggests that the greater the rating is, the more cooking prep time is needed to prepare better food. Although this alternative hypothesis was not directly tested, the lack of significant correlation between cooking time and average rating implies that there is no clear relationship supporting this claim.

In other words, the analysis did not find a strong linear relationship between cooking time and average rating. The correlation coefficient was found to be approximately -0.004, which is very close to zero. This indicates a weak or negligible linear relationship between the two variables.

Therefore, based on the analysis, we cannot conclude that there is a significant relationship between cooking time and average rating of recipes. Other factors, such as recipe quality, ingredients, or cooking techniques, may have a stronger influence on the average rating of recipes rather than just the cooking time alone.

By conducting the above steps, I aim to gain insights into the relationship between cooking time and the average rating of recipes. The findings from this analysis help me understand whether co
